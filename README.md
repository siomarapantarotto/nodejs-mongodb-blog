# Blog Corner

This repo cointains the "Blog Corner" web application implemented with:

- NodeJS
- Express
- EJS
- Morgan
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- etc

<b>Node.js</b> is a tool written in C++, which basically wraps the V8 engine, just like web browsers, and lets us write code in JavaScript and share it between the front end and back end of our projects.

<b>Express</b> is a lightweight and flexible web application framework in JavaScript that simplifies building server-side applications and APIs with Node.js, handling routing and HTTP requests. 

<b>MongoDB</b> is a super flexible NoSQL database that is a great fit for certain types of applications where a traditional, structured database might not be the best choice.
